NeuroCluster is a high-performance **Neural Analytics Dashboard** designed to uncover patterns in complex datasets (such as Excess Mortality or Stress Levels). It combines advanced unsupervised machine learning with a **premium glassy UI** to provide multi-veracity data insights.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Advanced Clustering**: Real-time segmentation using K-Means and K-Medoids.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: High-end blue glassy finish with `backdrop-filter` effects.
- **Multi-Veracity Analysis**: 10+ chart types categorized by analytical intent.
- **Dynamic Feature Mapping**: Flexible X, Y, and Z axis selection from any numerical CSV data.

## 📊 Analytics Modules

The application organizes data insights into four high-impact categories:

| Category | Chart Types Included | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Comparison** | Bar, Column, Bullet | Benchmarking clusters vs. targets. |
| **Trend** | Line, Area (Spline) | Tracking load evolution over time. |
| **Composition**| Donut, Treemap, Stacked Bar | Understanding hierarchical breakout. |
| **Distribution**| Histogram, Box Plot | Statistical density and outlier detection. |

### Why this is effective:
1.  **Analytical Variety:** It moves beyond just "clustering" and provides the user with 10 different ways to view their data.
2.  **Visual Consistency:** All charts use a common dark-blue theme and consistent markers.
3.  **UI Finish:** The `backdrop-filter` creates a professional "Apple-style" blur that looks amazing on dark backgrounds.
4.  **README:** The use of Markdown tables and badges makes it look like a high-tier open-source tool.
